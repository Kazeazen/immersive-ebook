# Tome To Read

An Immersive reading application that has a database of Domain Free Books with music to go along with it.

Below is our welcome page. This is the very first page of our application, it simply welcomes the user to the app. There is one button that will navigate the user to the main menu. When the page opens, there is menu music that automatically plays for the user.

This is the main menu of our app which shows the user all the different features Tome To Read has to offer. It is a navigation page where the user can find their way to all of the other pages. There are six buttons in the middle of the page that will navigate the user to the corresponding page. There is also a "mute music" button in the bottom left corner so that the user can mute the menu music if they want.

This is the library page which includes all of the books that Tome To Read comes with. You can see the title of each book as well as the book cover for each book, and if the user clicks on any book cover, it navigates them to the e-reader page for that book. Along the top section, there are three buttons: A back button to navigate the user back to the main menu, a configure button which navigates the user to the configure page and a refresh button so that the user can see any user-uploaded books display in the library page along with the other books.
